    <div id="about-content">
      <p>I started learning about software development back in my junior year of college. I hit the ground running, and earned my Computer Science degree just two years later. During that time, I participated in several internships at different startups working as a web developer. I also completed a residency with the New York City Tech Talent Pipeline, where I collaborated with others to build full-stack web applications.</p>
      <p>Since graduating, I have been continuing my studies through self-directed learning and hands-on experience with my project, GroupHQ. My focus is on supporting efficient development practices within parallel teams and navigating the unique challenges of enterprise-level environments.</p>
