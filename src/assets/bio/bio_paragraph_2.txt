Since graduation, Iâ€™ve been expanding my knowledge of enterprise development through self-directed learning and hands-on experience with my project, GroupHQ. My focus is on supporting efficient development practices within parallel teams and navigating the unique challenges of enterprise-level environments. Recently, I was accepted into the FastTrack program at Cook Systems, where I am training alongside other talented individuals to further enhance my enterprise development skills.
