I am a software engineer with a strong passion for continuous learning. My journey in software development began during my junior year of college, where my eagerness to learn helped me secure several internships, working as a web developer intern at various startups. I also completed a residency with the New York City Tech Talent Pipeline, where I collaborated with others to build full-stack web applications. I graduated magna cum laude from CUNY Brooklyn College with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
